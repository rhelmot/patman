patman will manage your patches.

patman works with an interface similar to git. Start projects, then make 
snapshots when you decide you're at a place you might want to get back to 
later. There's automatically an "original" snapshot made for you at the 
beginning, so that's nice.

Ideally, it would be able to stop and start services as it swapped patches, 
but that's for later.

Basic usage:

$ ls
binary  useful_data.txt
$ patman init project_name binary
$ patman status
Using snapshot original
$ vim useful_data.txt
$ patman status
Using snapshot original, with modifications:
useful_data.txt: Mod time differs
useful_data.txt: Size differs
$ patman snap datamod
$ patman status
Using snapshot datamod
$ patman use original
$ patman list
            original * 2014-07-28 16:10:30.155030
             datamod   2014-07-28 16:19:55.207026
$
